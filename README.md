# ⚽ Soccer Analysis Term Project – Real-Time Goal Prediction Using Big Data & AI  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project applies **Big Data analytics and Machine Learning (ML)** to **real-time soccer analysis**, predicting goal-scoring opportunities based on **event tracking data**. The system processes massive datasets (~12GB of match event data) and applies **Hadoop MapReduce, Random Forest models, and Neural Networks** to detect game patterns in **real-time**.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Processes 12GB+ of soccer event data** in real-time using **Hadoop MapReduce**.  
- **Predicts goal-scoring chances** using **Random Forest & Neural Networks**.  
- **Optimized for high-speed processing** with **distributed computing**.  
- **Visualizes key game trends** (player movement, tactical shifts).  

## 🎯 How It Works  
1. **Data Preprocessing (Hadoop MapReduce)** → Filters, cleans, and structures raw event data.  
2. **Feature Engineering (Python)** → Extracts key play-by-play features from the dataset.  
3. **Machine Learning Training**:  
   - **Random Forest Model** → Establishes baseline performance (~89% accuracy).  
   - **Neural Network Model** → Fine-tuned deep learning approach (~87% accuracy).  
4. **Prediction Output** → Identifies high-probability goal-scoring opportunities in real time.  

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- **Fine-tune Deep Learning Models** for >90% accuracy.  
- **Optimize Hadoop Processes** for even faster real-time data handling.  
- **Live Data Stream Integration** for in-game predictions.  

## 🏆 Why This Matters  
- **Professional Soccer Teams** → AI-driven insights for **in-game strategy adjustments**.  
- **Broadcasters & Analysts** → Enhances coverage with **real-time predictive analytics**.  
- **Sports Betting Industry** → Leverages AI-powered insights for more accurate betting odds.
