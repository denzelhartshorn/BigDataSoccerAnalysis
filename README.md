# âš½ Soccer Analysis Term Project â€“ Real-Time Goal Prediction Using Big Data & AI  

## ðŸš€ Overview  
This project applies **Big Data analytics and Machine Learning (ML)** to **real-time soccer analysis**, predicting goal-scoring opportunities based on **event tracking data**. The system processes massive datasets (~12GB of match event data) and applies **Hadoop MapReduce, Random Forest models, and Neural Networks** to detect game patterns in **real-time**.  

## âœ¨ Features  
- **Processes 12GB+ of soccer event data** in real-time using **Hadoop MapReduce**.  
- **Predicts goal-scoring chances** using **Random Forest & Neural Networks**.  
- **Optimized for high-speed processing** with **distributed computing**.  
- **Visualizes key game trends** (player movement, tactical shifts).
